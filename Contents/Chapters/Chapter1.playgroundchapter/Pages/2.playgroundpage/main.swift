 # Learning Traffic Signs 📚
 
 Now we know where the problem comes from. But how can we do something about it? 🤨 On the **right** you can see a view with the _most important_ traffic signs. 👉
 
### In principle, traffic signs can be divided into **3** main categories:
 
 1. **Danger signs** are among the most important traffic signs in road traffic. They indicate a hazard such as a danger area ⚠️, a crosswalk 🚶 or indicate oncoming traffic. 🚗 They are triangular with a red outline and depict the danger with simple symbols in black on a white background.
 
 2. **Regulatory signs** are divided into two different categories: Prohibition signs and Mandatory signs. Prohibition signs are usually round, with a red border on a white background. Mandatory signs are often round as well. However, they usually have white symbols on a blue background. Prescription signs are not only used to orient or inform drivers. As the names 'mandatory sign' and 'prohibition signs' might suggest, these traffic signs are laws (made visible). It is therefore essential that you follow the instructions given by the mandatory signs. ☝️ If you do not observe a regulation sign, you could face fines, a driving ban or even an extension of your probationary period. 👮
 
3. **Indicator signs** serve as special instructions to facilitate traffic. They can represent both commands and prohibitions and can be either informative or prescriptive. Anyone who participates in road traffic must comply with the commands and prohibitions given by directional signs. The traffic signs are usually placed from where you have to follow the instruction. Otherwise, a supplementary sign is attached. 😄
 
 The rest, which are not shown, can be deduced logically from the given structures. Do you recognize them? 🤔 If not, it does not really matter. You are, after all, a human being.
 
 Whenever you are ready and have had a good look and memorized the road signs, we can proceed. Let's go to the [**quiz**](@next)! 🤩
