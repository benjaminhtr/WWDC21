 # Welcome to Driving School! 🏫

 Hey, I'm Benjamin 👋 and I'm about to get my driver's license. 🚘 Today you will learn various road signs in a slightly different way. If you are planning a trip through Europe with a car or anything else, the rules will help you avoid fines (yes, they cost a lot of money), protect other drivers and just have a good time without annoying stress.
 
 ## Where exactly is the problem? 🤔
 Although the roads are becoming safer and safer due to technological advances and an improved system in general, traffic accidents still occur and, unfortunately for some, even end fatally. In Germany alone, the number of traffic accidents increased up to 2,685,661 in 2019, killing 384,230 people.
 To overcome this problem, I have developed this Playground so that learning traffic signs can take place from a young age and all learners can feel fun in the process.
 
 ### On the right you can see three graphs that illustrate the numbers visually:
 1. Driver misconduct in road traffic accidents with personal injury in 2019
 2. Fatalities in road traffic by selected traffic association type and localities in 2019
 3. Development of the number of road traffic fatalities with legal changes in Germany
 
 - Note: The statistics and numbers are from the [Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html).
 
 Now that we have familiarized ourselves with the problem and know why it is important to know traffic signs, we then turn our attention to [**learning**](@next).
